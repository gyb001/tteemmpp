		international human right. You will be liable for your subcontractor's acts or
		omissions including breach of confidentiality.</li>

		an impartial mediator. If we don't resolve the dispute within 60 days after the
		mediation demand, either of us may begin litigation. </li>

		Agreement is governed by USA and Delaware law without regard to conflict of

		sever that part. The rest of the provision remains fully enforceable.</li>

		<li><strong>Waiver</strong>. No waiver of any provision of
		this Agreement will be valid unless in a writing signed by an authorized
		representative of the waiving party that specifies the waived provision. That
		signed waiver will not constitute a waiver of any other provision. A party's failure
		or delay in enforcing any provision will not operate as a waiver.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Entire Agreement</strong>. Except for any
		non-disclosure agreement between you and Intel, this Agreement constitutes the
		entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements, between Intel and You
		concerning its subject matter.</li>
